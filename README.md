### AUTOMATUS: The Wizard101 botting interface

## ABOUT

Automatus is designed to be a botting interface for the popular botting library: WizWalker. Additional functionality has since been halted in light of preparation for Automatus v3, which will offer a numerous number of additional features by offering an ingame overlay. The project will shift from `Python`, to `C`.

## USAGE

<br>

## REQUIREMENTS

This version of the project currently requires ![Python](https://www.python.org/) and ![WizWalker](https://github.com/StarrFox/wizwalker).  
With PIP (as part of the default Python3 package), installation of the WizWalker package is easy:  
`pip install -U wizwalker`

## FUTURE

This project is far from completion. Originally built in hopes of automating couch potato farming, I continued to discover progressively more and more passionate Wizard botting communities until I eventually discovered that of WizWalker. From there, the scope of the project expanded until I no longer wanted to just make a bot, I wanted to make the ideal botting interface, where each bot "program" could be loaded as its own script. This is where this project unofficially halted.  

I have since realized additional benefits to botting by tapping into the game's memory. Subsequentely, the future of this project (aka Automatus v3) will instead be written in C and inject the Wizard101 graphical client to offer an overlay for realtime game assistance (debug information, zone teleportation, noclip, etc) as well as offering support for a custom scripting language, aimed at being as player-focused as possible. With this new interface, users can use the GUI to access scripts on the fly as opposed to loading them when the script initializes.  

Additionally, Automatus v3 will _ultimately_ seek to tie in with my other project, **Battlematus**. Battlematus is a PvP combat AI, because I am really bad at PvP. The integration of this will thus complete the Automatus suite...at least until Kingsisle shuts it down :)
