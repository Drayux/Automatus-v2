### AUTOMATUS: The Wizard101 botting interface

## ABOUT

Automatus is designed to be a botting interface for the popular botting library: WizWalker. Additional functionality has since been halted in light of preparation for Automatus v3, which will offer a numerous number of additional features by offering an ingame overlay. The project will shift from `Python`, to `C`.

## USAGE

## REQUIREMENTS

This version of the project currently requires ![Python](https://www.python.org/) and ![WizWalker](https://github.com/StarrFox/wizwalker).  
With PIP (as part of the default Python3 package), installation of the WizWalker package is easy:  
`pip install -U wizwalker`

## FUTURE

This project is far from completion. Originally built in hopes of automating couch potatoes, I continued to discover progressively more and more passionate Wizard botting communities until I eventually discovered WizWalker. From there, the scope of the project expanded until I no longer wanted to just make a bot, I wanted to make the idea botting interface, where each bot "program" could be loaded as its own script. This is where this project halts.  

I have since realized additional benefits to botting by tapping into the game's memory. So the future of this project (aka Automatus v3) will instead be a C project that injects the Wizard101 graphical client offering an overlay for realtime game assistance (debug information, zone teleportation, noclip) as well as offering support for a custom scripting language, aimed at being as player-focused as possible.  

Additionally, this project will _ultimately_ tie in with my other project, **Battlematus** with support for a combat AI, completing the Automatus suite. At least until Kingsisle shuts it down :)
